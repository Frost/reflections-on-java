Reflections on java...

So, someone asked me if you could make a java class call methods conditionally,
depending on some string input, sort of like `Object#send` in ruby.

Here is such an example.

Just compile everything, and run `java Main`. 

It will print a prompt that accepts commands from the `Commands` interface.

Quit by either pressing `^D` or typing the `exit` command.
